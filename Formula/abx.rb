  # The thin CLI is a compiled universal binary; the server runs under bun from
  # a bundle next to its vendored Playwright (Playwright can't be statically
  # compiled — it reads its package files from node_modules at runtime). The
  # CLI resolves ../libexec/abx-server.js relative to itself.

    bin.install "abx"
    libexec.install "abx-server.js", "node_modules"

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      abx drives Playwright's Chromium. Fetch it once after install:

        abx install-browser

      Or point abx at an existing browser instead:

        export ABX_CHROMIUM_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "0.1.2", shell_output("#{bin}/abx --version")
  end
end
